#ASL Bot
We apporoached this project with one goal in mind, to make Discord more accessible to those that are hard of hearing. 

---Discord commands---

/translate: when this prefix is entered into the text chat, all text following it is output as ASL and all words that our not found in our database will be spelled out through the ASL alphabet. 

/finger: When this prefix is entered into the text chata, all text following the prefix will be completely spelled out using the ASL alphabet. 

/add: When this prefix is entered, the user is prompted to enter a word and a valid video link. From here an admin will determine wether or not the word & link should be approved or denied.

/talk: When this prefix is entered, the bot will enter the voice channel and proceed to transcribe the audio and ouput it into text through ASL videos or by alphabet for words not found in our database.
